# Verilab Projects 🧠🔧

This repository is a collection of Verilog HDL projects built during my digital systems coursework and personal experimentation. It covers a wide range of fundamental topics in digital logic design — from basic gates to finite state machines and register-transfer-level modeling.

## 🗂️ Project Categories

- **Logic Gates & Testbenches**  
  OR, AND, NAND, XOR gate implementations and corresponding testbenches.

- **Arithmetic Circuits**  
  Binary Adders, Subtractors, Add/Subtract units, Comparators, and optimized designs.

- **Register Transfer & Sequential Logic**  
  Projects demonstrating register transfers, memory elements, and data paths.

- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**  
  Moore machine with graphical state diagram and testbenches.

- **Multiplexers, Decoders & Encoders**  
  Structural and behavioral implementations with simulations.

- **Verilog Transistor-Level Modeling**  
  Basic NMOS/PMOS transistor-based logic design.

- **Binary Codes and Representations**  
  Projects exploring Gray codes, BCD, and other number systems.

## 🔍 Highlight Project: Finite State Machine (FSM)

- Moore Machine modeled using Verilog
- Includes state transition diagram (PNG)
- Complete testbench with edge case testing
- Clean state encoding and modular design

This project is a strong demonstration of state machine design and simulation — and is likely to be pulled out into its own dedicated repository soon.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder typically includes:
- `.v` source files (Verilog modules)
- Testbenches (`*_Testbench.v`)
- Supplemental diagrams or documents, if any

## 📌 Note

This repo is intended as a **consolidated archive**. As I continue to refine and polish my work, individual standout projects will be moved to their own repositories with improved documentation and real-world use cases.
